# Game Plate Vision Analyzer

This project analyzes a physical game board in real-time using **OpenCV**, detects and identifies the pieces present, and reconstructs their positions digitally.  
A **Flask** web server provides a live interface to visualize the detected board state.

## Features
- Real-time video capture and analysis with OpenCV  
- Game piece detection and classification  
- Flask-based web interface for visualization and interaction  
- Modular and extensible architecture  

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
- **Numpy**
